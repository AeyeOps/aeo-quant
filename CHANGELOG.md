# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-04-24

Fail-fast hardening on `QUANT_FORMAT` resolution. Caught while running
the post-dep-refresh validation suite when a `.env` typo
(`QUANT_FORMAT=fpnv4`) silently loaded the FP8 checkpoint instead of
NVFP4 and wasted two minutes of model load before anyone noticed.

### Fixed

- **`quant_env()` no longer silently defaults or falls through on a
  bad `QUANT_FORMAT`.** Previously an unset value defaulted to `"fp8"`
  and any unrecognized string (typo, garbage) was silently accepted
  and routed to the FP8 checkpoint path, because the resolution used
  a ternary that picked `NVFP4_CHECKPOINT` only on exact `"nvfp4"`
  match and `FP8_CHECKPOINT` otherwise. Now both paths hard-fail with
  `sys.exit(1)` and a remediation message:
  - Unset: `[FATAL] QUANT_FORMAT is not set. Set it to 'fp8' or
    'nvfp4' in .env or as an env var.`
  - Unrecognized: `[FATAL] QUANT_FORMAT={value!r} is not recognized.
    Expected 'fp8' or 'nvfp4'. Check .env for typos.`
  A typo now fails in milliseconds instead of 2+ minutes into the
  wrong model load. Matches the existing fail-fast pattern already
  used for the missing-checkpoint case at `config.py:128`.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-04-24

Documentation, tooling, and lint/type-clean release. No functional
product changes. NVFP4 decode throughput unchanged from v0.1.14 — the
in-`transformers` optimization track is recorded as complete.

### Added

- **"Decode throughput journey" and "What we tried that didn't make the
  cut" README sections.** 7-row tok/s progression table from the v0.1.0
  bf16 dequant baseline (7.82) through v0.1.14's kernel-side expert
  gather (~18.7) to the current 16–19 tok/s envelope, plus a grouped
  inventory of rejected experiments (quality regressions, perf
  no-change, not-significant) each pointing to the authoritative plan
  or CHANGELOG writeup.
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-23-in-transformers-envelope-closed.md`** —
  closing writeup with the post-v0.1.14 CUDA-time breakdown and
  disposition of the remaining probe-first levers (router NVFP4,
  prefill autotune, MoE elementwise fusion — each <1 tok/s at envelope
  noise floor).
- **`ty`** (Astral's fast Python type checker, Beta) added to `[dev]`
  extras. `ruff` floor bumped `0.8` → `0.15`.
- **`PROFILE_MIN_FREE_GB` env knob** in `examples/profile_generate.py`
  — override the 50 GB preflight floor when co-resident with another
  workload (e.g. vLLM on the same GB10). Documented in README and
  `examples/README.md` knobs lists.

### Changed

- **HF authentication guidance** in `README.md` and
  `examples/README.md` rewritten. No aeo-quant code reads `HF_TOKEN`;
  docs now direct users to `hf auth login` (token cached at
  `~/.cache/huggingface/token`) and warn against re-adding `HF_TOKEN`
  to `.env` (dual-copy rotation liability).
- **"Actively evolving" README status caveat** replaced with explicit
  envelope-closed language pointing at the closing writeup. The
  harness surface, parity tooling, and dashboards continue to evolve.
- **`docs/gemma4-fp8-optimization.md` description** in the Documentation
  section marked as FP8-era log, superseded by the NVFP4 track.
- **`multi_turn_16k.py` / `multi_turn_32k.py` dashboard titles** use
  `QUANT_FORMAT` (format-aware) instead of hardcoded `"Gemma 4 FP8"`.
- **`parity_long_check.py` docstring** no longer references a
  pre-SWA-fix v0.1.9 commit hash as the baseline origin; replaced with
  current-SWA-aware-cache description.
- **`quality_check.py` `TOK_S_FLOOR`** raised 3.0 → 8.0. Matches the
  v0.1.0 FP8 baseline — anything below our own starting point is
  unambiguously a regression. The 3.0 floor was 5–6× looser than the
  current 16–19 tok/s envelope.
- **`uv` upgraded** 0.9.24 → 0.11.7.
- **Full dependency refresh via `uv lock --upgrade`.** `transformers
  5.5.4 → 5.6.2`, `huggingface-hub 1.10.1 → 1.11.0`, `pytest 8.x →
  9.0.3`, plus minor/patch bumps (certifi, click, cuda-pathfinder,
  filelock, idna, matplotlib, packaging, typer).
- **Status/caveats dependency-reference versions** bumped to match
  the current locked versions (`transformers 5.6.2`, `turboquant
  0.2.0`, `torch 2.11.0`, `triton 3.6.0`, CUDA 13.0 on GB10 `sm_121`).

### Fixed

- **All 13 ruff findings resolved.** 9 auto-fixed (import sorting,
  PEP 604 Optional syntax); 4 manual: `try/except/pass` →
  `contextlib.suppress` in `streamer.py` and `writers.py`, collapsed
  nested `if` in `config.py`, `if/else` block → ternary in
  `nvfp4_matmul.py`.
- **All 63 ty findings resolved.** Strategies:
  - `nvfp4_matmul.py` excluded via `[tool.ty.src]` — ty can't model
    Triton `tl.constexpr` and launch-time specialization.
  - Class-level `torch.Tensor` annotations added to
    `Gemma4TextExpertsFP8`, `Gemma4TextExpertsNVFP4`, and `LinearFP8`
    to narrow PyTorch's `Module` generic attribute typing (removes
    ~14 false positives).
  - `OUTPUT_DIR: Path` narrowing in both `build_checkpoint*.py`
    (separate `_OUTPUT_DIR_ENV` env read + explicit annotated `Path`
    assignment).
  - Legacy `BoolTensor/LongTensor/FloatTensor` signatures in
    `gpu/memory.py` replaced with `torch.Tensor` (legacy aliases
    don't round-trip through `torch.zeros/ones`).
  - `core/types.py` `object` parameter types upgraded to
    `Callable[..., Any]` / `Any`; redundant `# type: ignore` comments
    removed.
  - `matplotlib.Figure.tight_layout(rect=...)` list → tuple.
  - Explicit None checks added in `Gemma4HybridTurboQuantCache` for
    all four Optional tensor fields (was checking only
    `_key_indices`).
  - Targeted `# ty: ignore` on the two intentional class-swap lines
    in `loader.py` and on the transformers 5.6+ cache-layer union
    call in `cache.py`.
  - Compatibility shim `np.trapz = np.trapezoid` (for turboquant
    0.2.0 on numpy 2.x) gets `# ty: ignore[unresolved-attribute]`
    alongside the existing mypy directive.
- **`profile_generate.py` nsys conditional import** flagged `I001` +
  `E501` under newly-installed ruff. Reformatted as a multi-line
  import with `# noqa: I001` (ruff's isort can't model the
  pre-torch-import placement required for nsys process wrapping).

## [0.1.15] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Published NVFP4 checkpoint:
  [`aeyeops/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-nvfp4`](https://huggingface.co/aeyeops/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-nvfp4).**
  ~19 GB artifact (4 shards), 1133 tensors total — 180 NVFP4 buffers
  (60 packed uint8 weights + 60 fp8_e4m3 per-block scales + 60 fp32
  per-tensor scales across 30 MoE layers × 2 projections) plus 953 bf16
  pass-through (attention, embeddings, norms, router, vision encoder).
  Sits alongside the existing FP8 checkpoint as the second canonical
  download-and-run artifact. License inherits Gemma terms from the base
  model. Validated on GB10 Max Pro (Blackwell `sm_121`) with
  `TRITON_OVERRIDE_ARCH=sm120`; byte-for-byte parity match vs pinned
  baselines (0/50 and 0/300 mismatches); torch_alloc peak 17.49 GB.
  Full model-card content + kernel-path description + limitations on
  the Hub README.

### Changed

- **`README.md` dual-product restructure.** Hero, tagline, mermaid
  diagram, SDK-at-a-glance tree, Quantization-bridges section,
  Configuration section, Quickstart, Documentation, and Status/caveats
  all now frame FP8 and NVFP4 as parallel canonical paths.
  `QUANT_FORMAT` is documented as the single switch users need to know;
  both `*_CHECKPOINT` env vars and both HF URLs are surfaced. Added
  pointer to the new `docs/2026-04-17-nvfp4-sm121-breakthrough.md`
  deep-dive.
- **`examples/README.md`** updated in parallel. Every example's section
  shows the default FP8 invocation and the `QUANT_FORMAT=nvfp4` variant.
  Added missing entries for `parity_long_check.py`, `reasoning_check.py`,
  and `build_checkpoint_nvfp4.py` (previously omitted from the docs
  despite being part of the canonical set per `examples/CLAUDE.md`).

### Fixed

- **Version-string drift in `src/aeo_quant/__init__.py`** — was stuck at
  `0.1.0` since the initial release while `pyproject.toml` tracked
  forward through 14 releases. Drive-by sync fix: now `0.1.15`, matching
  the package version.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Kernel-side expert gather for the MoE decode matmul.** A new Triton
  kernel `_nvfp4_matmul_kernel_3d_gather` and launcher
  `nvfp4_linear_3d_gather` let `Gemma4TextExpertsNVFP4._forward_decode_3d`
  pass the full `(E=128, ...)` expert-weight tensors straight to the
  kernel, which picks each selected expert via `expert_ids[pid_e]`
  indirection. The four prior `index_select` calls per layer
  (`gate_up_proj`, `gate_up_proj_scale`, `down_proj`, `down_proj_scale`)
  are gone — 120 per-step launches eliminated, plus the `(k, ...)`
  gathered-weight tensor allocations they triggered. Arithmetic is
  byte-for-byte identical to 0.1.13 (same FP4 weights, same fp32
  accumulation order, same rounding). The non-gather launcher
  `nvfp4_linear_3d_prequantized` is retained unchanged for the prefill
  per-expert path.

### Performance

- Decode throughput on NVFP4 + `Gemma4HybridTurboQuantCache` improves
  from ~16.3 to ~18.7 tok/s on the parity prompt (+15%, GB10 sm_121,
  prompt_len=41, 41-token decode window). The win is purely in
  eliminated launch overhead — profile confirms the
  `aten::index_select` (10.8%) and `indexSelectSmallIndex` (10.8%)
  buckets collapse to 0%; the gather kernel's own CUDA time grows from
  7.9 ms to 26.5 ms across 5 decode steps (it absorbs the work), but
  the removed per-step allocations, DMA copies, and launch latency net
  out to a ~8 ms/step wall-clock win.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Dropped the `torch.compile(mode="reduce-overhead")` wrap from both
  `load_gemma4_fp8` and `load_gemma4_nvfp4`.** Compile is a no-op via
  `transformers.generate()` (HF's generate bypasses `OptimizedModule.__call__`
  on the inner decoder loop), and is actively harmful on direct
  `model(...)` calls — its internal `cudagraph_trees` conflicts with
  `Gemma4HybridTurboQuantCache`'s `torch.cat`-based growth (`RuntimeError:
  accessing tensor output of CUDAGraphs that has been overwritten by a
  subsequent run`) and also fights explicit `torch.cuda.graph()` capture.
  Loaders now return the raw `AutoModelForCausalLM` instance. No speedup
  lost; blocker for any future direct-forward / graph-capture work removed.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **NVFP4 matmul launchers no longer call `.item()` on the fused alpha
  scalar.** Both `nvfp4_linear_prequantized` (2D prefill path) and
  `nvfp4_linear_3d_prequantized` (3D decode path) now pass the fused
  `a_tensor_scale * w_tensor_scale` as a 0-D device tensor, and the two
  Triton kernels (`_nvfp4_matmul_kernel`, `_nvfp4_matmul_kernel_3d`) load
  it via `tl.load(alpha_ptr)` in the epilogue before the bf16 down-cast.
  Arithmetic is bit-identical (same fp32 multiply, just on device); parity
  check passes byte-for-byte vs the prior `.item()` launcher. The change
  removes one forced host sync per expert matmul — on Gemma 4 decode
  that's dozens of cudaStreamSynchronize calls per token — and makes the
  decode path compatible with `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` capture, which
  disallows host syncs mid-capture.
- **`_FP4_BOUNDS` and `_FP4_LUT` are cached per device.** The activation
  quantization path (`quantize_2d_to_nvfp4` → `_round_to_fp4_e2m1`) was
  doing `_FP4_BOUNDS.to(mag.device)` on every call — a CPU→GPU copy on
  every decode step, and also a CUDA-graph-capture blocker (unpinned
  host→device copies aren't legal mid-capture). Replaced with lazy
  per-device caches keyed on `str(device)`. First use on a device
  populates the cache; subsequent calls return the GPU-resident tensor
  directly. No behavior change under eager; unblocks graph capture.

### Performance

- Decode throughput on NVFP4 + `Gemma4HybridTurboQuantCache` improves
  from the prior ~12.5–13.7 tok/s band to ~15.8 tok/s on the standard
  parity prompt (GB10 sm_121). The improvement comes entirely from the
  eliminated per-step host sync (alpha `.item()`) and the eliminated
  per-step CPU→GPU copy (`_FP4_BOUNDS`). Both are independently correct
  under eager execution — CUDA graph compatibility is a forward-looking
  co-benefit of the same fixes.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Root `CLAUDE.md`** codifying the architectural rule: `src/` is the SDK,
  and references go outside → in only. Core code must not reference
  `examples/`, `tests/`, `tmp/`, `docs/`, `kb/`, or `tools/` in imports,
  docstrings, or comments — anything outside `src/` may not exist in the
  future, and a lying comment is worse than a missing one. Includes the
  repo directory map and the operating principles accumulated this
  session (shrink tracked surface before polishing references; iteration
  artifacts are not tests; no test-harness ambitions while the design
  evolves; historical documents stay historical).
- **`examples/CLAUDE.md`** — `examples/` is product surface that ships
  with the SDK, not a scratchpad. Defines the inclusion bar
  (format-agnostic, harness-based, documented in README) and names the
  alternatives (`tmp/` for throwaways, `tests/` for regression harnesses
  when we build them).
- **`tmp/CLAUDE.md`** + gitignored `tmp/` directory — explicit scratch
  space for iteration artifacts. Not tracked, not maintained, not
  referenced from any tracked document or `src/` comment. When a script
  "solves a problem in a moment," that's what it is — a moment.

### Changed

- **`quant_env()` auto-applies the nvfp4 Triton arch coercion.** When
  `QUANT_FORMAT=nvfp4` resolves, `ensure_nvfp4_triton_arch()` sets
  `TRITON_OVERRIDE_ARCH=sm120` via `os.environ.setdefault`, preserving any
  explicit user pin (e.g. for benchmarking the fallback path). Every
  entry point that goes through `quant_env()` — harness daemon, all
  SDK examples — now "just works" on sm_121 (GB10) without the user
  remembering the sm_120 lowering quirk. The `[nvfp4] WARNING: ...`
  print at load time is gone; the previously required
  `TRITON_OVERRIDE_ARCH=sm120 uv run ...` prefix has been stripped from
  example docstrings.

### Removed

- **`src/aeo_quant/gpu/kernel_probe.py`** — 230-line subprocess runner
  for probe scripts that had zero callers inside `src/`. Its only
  consumers were the one-off probes moved to `tmp/` this release. Dead
  code living in the SDK surface; removed wholesale.
- **Outside-world references from `src/` docstrings and comments.**
  Stripped pointers to `kb/nvfp4-blackwell-research.md`,
  `docs/plans/*.md`, and `examples/*.py` from
  `gpu/nvfp4_matmul.py`, `bridges/gemma4/loader.py`,
  `bridges/gemma4/modeling_nvfp4.py`, and
  `workloads/{parity,reasoning,quality}.py`. Core code no longer knows
  that anything exists outside `src/`.

### Housekeeping — `examples/` reorganization

Sixteen files removed from `examples/` to match the new
`examples/CLAUDE.md` bar:

- **Moved to `tmp/` (gitignored, untracked):** `smoke_nvfp4.py`,
  `probe_logits_at_divergence.py`, `probe_nvfp4_aot.py`,
  `probe_nvfp4_aot_3d.py`, `probe_nvfp4_minimal.py`,
  `probe_nvfp4_torchao.py`, `compile_probe.py`, `cuda_graph_probe.py`,
  `fp4_probe.py`, `safe_probe.py`, `tune_nvfp4_kernel.py`,
  `profile_nvfp4_decode.py`, `test_nvfp4_kernel.py`,
  `test_nvfp4_3d_kernel.py`, `test_nvfp4_3d_ab_alpha.py`,
  `test_nvfp4_bridge.py`. All were one-day bring-up artifacts from the
  nvfp4 native-matmul and 3D-kernel work; git history confirms none had
  been touched since the investigation that produced them concluded.
  The `test_*` files were standalone `main() → int` scripts, not
  pytest-discoverable — a real test suite was never the goal.
- `examples/` now holds only canonical SDK surface: the `parity_check`,
  `parity_long_check`, `quality_check`, `reasoning_check`,
  `multi_turn_16k`, `multi_turn_32k`, `profile_generate`, and
  `build_checkpoint*` scripts, plus `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **`Gemma4HybridTurboQuantCache`** in `aeo_quant.bridges.gemma4.cache` — a
  SWA-aware KV cache that pre-populates `self.layers` with per-layer backends
  based on `config.layer_types` and `config.sliding_window`.
  - `TurboQuantSlidingLayer(TurboQuantLayer)` caps compressed storage at
    `sliding_window − 1 − residual_len` tokens (895 with defaults) by trimming
    the head of `_key_indices`/`_key_norms`/`_value_indices`/`_value_norms`
    after the parent's `update` runs. The return tensors are untouched so the
    current step's attention mask shape still matches — trimming only shrinks
    storage for the *next* update.
  - `get_mask_sizes(query_length)` on sliding layers mirrors the formula from
    transformers' `DynamicSlidingWindowLayer` verbatim, so
    `transformers.masking_utils` builds the correct sliding-window mask.
  - Full-attention layers (5 of 30 on Gemma 4) stay as vanilla
    `TurboQuantLayer` — unbounded growth is correct for them.
  - Validates `num_kv_shared_layers == 0` and raises `NotImplementedError` on
    unknown `layer_type` values so the next model variant fails loud.
- **`examples/parity_long_check.py`** — 2000-token greedy parity gate. The
  50-token `parity_check.py` never crosses the 1024-token sliding window;
  `parity_long_check.py` does, so any SWA-eviction bug surfaces here.
  First run establishes `tests/fixtures/parity_long_baseline_{fp8,nvfp4}.txt`;
  subsequent runs fail if token-level divergence > 0.5%.

### Changed

- **All four workload modules** (`parity`, `reasoning`, `quality`,
  `multi_turn`) now construct `Gemma4HybridTurboQuantCache(bits=kv_bits,
  config=model.config)` instead of `TurboQuantCache(bits=kv_bits)`. No API
  change visible to callers; existing workload kwargs are preserved.

### Performance (expected, post-validation)

At 16K context, ~80% of the per-step dequant workload on the stock cache is
on sliding-layer history older than the 1024-token window — data the attention
kernel then masks out. `Gemma4HybridTurboQuantCache` eliminates that wasted
work. Cost-model estimates: **2–3× decode tok/s at 16K, 3–5× at 32K**. These
are predictions; measured numbers will be recorded here after the comparator
runs (see `docs/plans/bubbly-humming-deer.md` for the verification protocol).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Three new workloads** in `aeo_quant.workloads`, completing the retrofit
  commitment from v0.1.8:
  - `reasoning` — 2 hard prompts (Sylow proof, concurrent LRU bugs), 500
    tokens each. Per-prompt events and per-prompt output records that carry a
    `file` field; baselines live at
    `results/reasoning/baseline_<format>-<bits>bit/` (per-format, per-bits).
  - `quality` — 3 diverse prompts (quicksort, merkle tree, pandas). Workload
    is pure compute; coherence check and the `tok/s >= 3.0` gate run on the
    client so the workload contract stays free of pass/fail semantics.
  - `multi_turn` — long multi-turn conversations with KV cache reuse, target
    context (16K / 32K), per-turn metrics/transcript/memtrail files written to
    a client-provided `out_dir`, `MemoryCapStoppingCriteria` watchdog. Emits
    `turn_start`, `thinking_text`, `thinking_end`, `answer_chunk`,
    `turn_complete`, and `memory_warning` events.
- **`HarnessStreamer`** (`aeo_quant.bridges.gemma4.streamer`) — subclasses
  `LiveStreamer` to inherit its phase machine and TTFT tracking; overrides
  `on_finalized_text` to emit structured events through an `emit` callback
  instead of writing ANSI-decorated text to stderr. Thinking is part of the
  model's output, so it's always streamed as `thinking_text` events (with a
  buffer tail preserved across calls so close markers split at the boundary
  still resolve). Clients render thinking in dim-cyan under a `[thinking]`
  header, answer in bold under `[answer]` — the two phases are visually
  distinct from each other and from user/tool content.

### Changed

- **All five benchmark examples now run via the harness daemon.** Four
  examples retrofitted onto the streaming protocol (the fifth, `parity_check`,
  shipped in v0.1.8):
  - `examples/reasoning_check.py` — harness-only, no in-process model load.
  - `examples/quality_check.py` — harness-only and generalized to
    `QUANT_FORMAT` (reads from `quant_env()` like the others); drops the
    `FP8_CHECKPOINT` hardcoding so NVFP4 quality runs work without a code
    change.
  - `examples/multi_turn_16k.py` and `examples/multi_turn_32k.py` —
    harness-only. The client reconstructs live terminal UX (dim-cyan
    `[thinking]`, bold `[answer]`, carriage-return status line) from streamed
    events, then generates the transcript HTML and dashboard PNG.
- **`stdout.log` scope for retrofitted examples.** Content that previously
  came from the in-process generation loop (per-turn `CudaTimer`,
  `mem_report`, etc.) now originates in the daemon and goes to
  `~/.aeo-quant/harness.log`. Client-side `stdout.log` retains preflight,
  event summaries, and post-run diffs. `tail ~/.aeo-quant/harness.log` for
  full daemon-side detail.
- **`LIVE=0` and `VERBOSE_THINK=1` env vars removed from
  `multi_turn_16k.py` / `multi_turn_32k.py`.** Thinking is part of the model's
  output, so the workload always streams it — no config flag, no alternate
  heartbeat mode. Users who want a silent run can redirect stderr:
  `uv run examples/multi_turn_16k.py 2>/dev/null`.
- **`results_dir()` now stamps the quant format and KV bits into the
  run-stem** when callers pass `format=` and `kv_bits=`. Layout is now
  `results/<category>/<format>-<bits>bit-<timestamp>/` for all four
  retrofitted examples — sortable by time, groupable by quant shape via
  glob (e.g. `ls results/reasoning/nvfp4-3bit-*`). The bare-timestamp
  layout is still the fallback when format/bits aren't supplied, and
  `RESULTS_DIR` env override still bypasses all formatting. The reasoning
  baseline path moved to `results/reasoning/baseline_<format>-<bits>bit/`
  so an FP8 baseline can no longer be silently compared against an NVFP4
  run (which was the source of the 86.8% divergence seen in the v0.1.8
  NVFP4 verification).

## [0.1.8] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Harness daemon** (`aeo_quant.harness`) — a long-running UNIX-socket
  service that loads the Gemma 4 model once and serves workload requests
  from multiple clients. First call to an example auto-spawns the daemon
  in the background; subsequent calls connect instantly to the already-
  loaded model, eliminating the ~140s load cost per invocation. Daemon
  is mutually-exclusive on `QUANT_FORMAT` — switching formats requires
  `aeo-harness stop && <new-format example>` which auto-spawns a fresh
  daemon.
  - `aeo-harness start [--format fp8|nvfp4]` — foreground or auto-spawn
  - `aeo-harness status` — current format, uptime, jobs_served, queue_depth
  - `aeo-harness stop` — graceful shutdown, frees ~27 GB
  - Socket at `~/.aeo-quant/harness.sock`, log at `~/.aeo-quant/harness.log`
- **Workloads subsystem** (`aeo_quant.workloads`) — pure-compute functions
  callable either in-process or via the harness. First workload landed:
  `workloads.parity.run()`. Additional workloads (reasoning, quality,
  multi_turn) arrive in a follow-up.
- **Log tailing during daemon spawn** — when an example auto-spawns the
  daemon, the parent streams `~/.aeo-quant/harness.log` to the user's
  terminal during the ~140s model load, so you see live progress (shard
  loading, NVFP4→FP8 conversion, etc.) instead of an opaque
  "waiting..." message.
- **Streaming event protocol** — server can emit zero or more
  `status: event` lines before the terminal `status: ok`/`status: error`
  reply. Clients receive events via a default stdout printer or an
  optional `on_event` callback — no opt-in required. Unlocks long-running
  workloads (multi_turn, future chat) with live progress without adding
  configuration surface.
- **Thread-pool workload execution on the server** — workloads now run
  via `loop.run_in_executor`, keeping the asyncio event loop responsive
  during generate() calls so streaming events flow in real time and
  concurrent `status` probes work.

### Changed

- **`examples/parity_check.py`** — refactored to always use the harness.
  `get_or_start_harness()` replaces the earlier manual load path;
  in-process fallback removed (failing loudly is more honest than
  silently reloading a 27 GB model when the daemon is misconfigured).
  Format mismatch between daemon and requested `QUANT_FORMAT` is a fatal
  error with clear remediation text.
- **`pyproject.toml`** — added `[project.scripts]` entry point for
  `aeo-harness`.

### Fixed

- **`Tee.write` / `Tee.flush` resilient to closed streams.** At interpreter
  shutdown, `atexit` may close the log file before Python's final
  `sys.stdout.flush()` runs, producing `Exception ignored while flushing
  sys.stdout` on `reasoning_check` and `profile_generate`. `Tee` now
  suppresses per-stream `ValueError`/`OSError` so one dead stream doesn't
  kill the other, and shutdown is clean.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **`parity_check.py` — per-format baselines, SDK-aligned output path.**
  Replaced the single shared `tests/fixtures/parity_baseline.txt` with
  per-format files `parity_baseline_fp8.txt` and `parity_baseline_nvfp4.txt`.
  Each format compares against its own baseline as the regression gate;
  NVFP4 runs additionally compare against the FP8 baseline as an
  informational quality delta (never fails the run). Fixes the prior
  bug where whichever format ran last silently overwrote the other's
  pinned reference.
- **Parity output now uses the standard `results_dir()` timestamped
  subdirectory pattern** (`results/parity/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/output.txt`),
  matching `multi_turn_*`, `profile_generate`, `reasoning_check`,
  `compile_probe`. The inline `datetime.strftime` was the last remaining
  duplication of the SDK's timestamp helper; date/time format now lives
  in one place (`core/config.py:results_dir`).

### Added

- **`docs/plans/2026-04-16-native-nvfp4-matmul.md`** — roadmap spec for
  replacing the NVFP4→FP8 load-time conversion with a native NVFP4
  block-scaled matmul on sm_121. Documents the Triton tutorial-10 base
  kernel, the three required deltas (per-tensor fp32 scale fold-in,
  `matmul_ogs` TMA guard bypass, `sm_121f` compile target), small-M
  vs large-M tile split, and six ordered verification gates. Pre-gated
  by a 20-minute torchao `_addmm_nvfp4_dispatch` probe to rule out a
  zero-code integration path.
- **`kb/nvfp4-blackwell-research.md`** — new section "Native NVFP4
  matmul path on sm_121 — 2026-04-16 survey" with candidate kernel
  inventory, sm_121 shared-memory budget notes (99 KiB vs B200's
  228 KiB), and reference links.
- **`docs/gemma4-fp8-optimization.md`** — roadmap table of next
  decode-speed optimizations (R1 prompt lookup, R2 native NVFP4 matmul,
  R3 assisted decoding, R4 static KV cache) scoped to transformers only.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`preflight_memory(min_available_gb, *, label)`** in `gpu/memory.py` —
  fail-fast check that refuses to start heavy workloads when the unified
  memory pool doesn't have enough free headroom. Prevents the "system
  buckling" scenario on shared GB10 where other processes have consumed
  so much memory that our workload's peak would push into swap-thrashing
  or OOM territory. Prints a PASS line on success so operators can see
  the headroom; exits 2 with a clear message on failure.
- All heavy example scripts now call `preflight_memory()` at startup
  with workload-specific minimums (documented as `MIN_FREE_GB` constants):
  - `parity_check.py`, `profile_generate.py`, `quality_check.py`,
    `compile_probe.py`, `cuda_graph_probe.py` — 50 GB
  - `reasoning_check.py` — 55 GB (longer decode)
  - `multi_turn_16k.py`, `multi_turn_32k.py` — 60 GB (KV growth)
  - `build_checkpoint.py`, `build_checkpoint_nvfp4.py` — 60 GB (~53 GB RSS peak)

### Changed

- Removed preexisting unused `pathlib.Path` imports from
  `multi_turn_16k.py`, `multi_turn_32k.py`, and `profile_generate.py`.
- `build_checkpoint*.py` — added `# noqa: SIM118` to `f.keys()` calls
  (safetensors `safe_open` requires `.keys()` for iteration).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-16

### Removed

- **`.fp8_cache/` sidecar and all cache save/load code in `load_gemma4_nvfp4()`.**
  The cache was designed to skip a 30–60s NVFP4→FP8 conversion on subsequent
  loads, but the batched-16-experts conversion optimization added in v0.1.4
  reduced conversion cost to ~10s. Measured cache load (~124s of disk I/O
  for 21 GB of shards) was consistently ~114s *slower* than just reconverting.
  Removing the cache simplifies the loader, eliminates stale-cache risk, and
  makes load times predictable. Full write-up in `docs/gemma4-fp8-optimization.md`
  Step 6. **If you have a `.fp8_cache/` directory inside your NVFP4 checkpoint
  dir from v0.1.4, delete it — it is no longer used.**

### Changed

- `load_gemma4_nvfp4()` now always runs the NVFP4→FP8 conversion. Total NVFP4
  load time: ~107s (97s `from_pretrained` + 10s conversion + compile wrap),
  same as before on first load, ~115s faster than the (broken) cached path.
- Docstring and module docstring in `bridges/gemma4/loader.py` updated to
  document why the cache was removed.

### Added

- Diagnostic logging in `load_gemma4_nvfp4()` — per-layer timing,
  `mem_report()` at key checkpoints, helps catch future memory regressions.
- `parity_check.py` now prints stage-by-stage timing and memory reports.
- KB note `kb/nvfp4-blackwell-research.md`: "Conversion Cache Removed" section.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **NVFP4 quantization pipeline** — full support for NVIDIA's microscaling
  FP4 (E2M1 with two-level FP8 block scales, block_size=16). Stores
  checkpoint at ~23 GB (vs 28.8 GB FP8, -19%); dequants to FP8 at load
  time for the proven `_scaled_mm` inference path.
  - `quantize_3d_to_nvfp4` / `dequant_3d_from_nvfp4` in `gpu/quant.py`
  - `quantize_2d_to_nvfp4` / `dequant_2d_from_nvfp4` (2D variants)
  - `Gemma4TextExpertsNVFP4` in `bridges/gemma4/modeling_nvfp4.py`
  - `load_gemma4_nvfp4()` in `bridges/gemma4/loader.py` — loads NVFP4
    checkpoint, converts to FP8, caches conversion in `.fp8_cache/`
  - `load_gemma4()` dispatcher — routes by `quant_format` parameter
  - `examples/build_checkpoint_nvfp4.py` — shard-streaming builder
- `quant_env()` in `core/config.py` — centralized env var reading for
  `QUANT_FORMAT`, `CHECKPOINT` / `FP8_CHECKPOINT` / `NVFP4_CHECKPOINT`,
  and `KV_BITS` (defaults: fp8/4-bit; nvfp4/3-bit).

### Changed

- **Example scripts unified** — `profile_generate.py`, `parity_check.py`,
  `reasoning_check.py`, `multi_turn_16k.py`, `multi_turn_32k.py` all use
  `quant_env()` + `load_gemma4()`. Set `QUANT_FORMAT=nvfp4` to switch.
  FP8 remains the default; no existing behavior changes.
- `.env` — added `NVFP4_CHECKPOINT` entry.

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- `results_dir(category, timestamped=True)` in `core/config.py` — SDK
  utility for timestamped results directories. Honors `RESULTS_DIR` env
  var as override. Replaces per-script boilerplate.
- `Tee` class in `core/writers.py` — multi-stream writer for
  stdout + log file tee. Replaces identical `_Tee` classes that were
  copy-pasted across example scripts.
- `openpyxl>=3.1` added to `plots` optional dependency group.

### Changed

- **All example scripts now use `results_dir()`** — timestamped output
  directories created via the SDK instead of per-script `Path()` +
  `mkdir()` + `strftime` boilerplate. Prevents results from being
  overwritten between runs.
- Removed unused `datetime` imports from `compile_probe.py`,
  `profile_generate.py`, and `reasoning_check.py`.

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- `examples/reasoning_check.py` — two hard reasoning prompts (Sylow
  subgroup proof, concurrent LRU cache bug hunt) that stress attention
  precision under different KV cache bit widths. Parameterized via
  `KV_BITS` env var, default 4.

### Changed

- **`KV_BITS` env var standardized** across all example scripts
  (`parity_check.py`, `profile_generate.py`, `compile_probe.py`,
  `cuda_graph_probe.py`, `quality_check.py`, `multi_turn_16k.py`,
  `multi_turn_32k.py`, `reasoning_check.py`). Replaces the old
  hardcoded `TURBOQUANT_BITS = 4`. Default is 4; users can set
  `KV_BITS=3` (or 2) to experiment with lower-precision KV cache.

### Removed

- `docs/archive/` — session continuation prompts from earlier Claude
  Code sessions. Internal artifacts, not public-facing docs.
- `examples/archive/` — old TRT-era validation scripts
  (`bf16_reference.py`, `nvfp4_validate.py`, `turboquant_validate.py`).
  Superseded by `quality_check.py` and `parity_check.py`.
- `tests/fixtures/parity_baseline.txt` — parity baseline is
  runtime-generated on first run, not a shipped fixture.

### Documented

- **TurboQuant 3-bit KV cache test results.** Tested against 4-bit
  using two reasoning-intensive 500-token prompts. Both produce correct
  reasoning at 3-bit (math proof valid, all 4 LRU bugs found) but
  86–98% token divergence from cascade effect. No decode speedup.
  Decision: 4-bit stays default — no memory pressure at 32K context
  (3.15 GB KV cache fits easily). Revisit 3-bit at 128K+ where
  the 3.15 GB savings becomes meaningful.
- E5M2 (`float8_e5m2`) format rejection: hardware requires E4M3 for
  RowWise `_scaled_mm` on Blackwell; E5M2 has half the mantissa
  precision and its wider range is irrelevant under per-row scaling.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-16

Building blocks for non-MoE FP8 quantization, plus documentation
improvements based on the initial public release.

### Added

- `quantize_2d_to_fp8` in `gpu/quant.py` — per-output-row FP8
  quantization for standard 2D weight matrices (`nn.Linear`). Companion
  to the existing `quantize_3d_to_fp8` for fused MoE experts.
- `LinearFP8` in `bridges/gemma4/linear_fp8.py` — drop-in `nn.Linear`
  replacement that stores FP8 weights with fp32 per-output-channel
  scales. Shared `fp8_linear()` function usable by both `LinearFP8` and
  the MoE expert path. `from_linear()` classmethod for in-place
  conversion.

### Changed

- **README restructured** — SDK-at-a-glance tree and Mermaid
  architecture diagram up front; full "What it does" details below.
  Hero section highlights the published FP8 checkpoint
  ([aeyeops/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-fp8](https://huggingface.co/aeyeops/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-fp8))
  with TurboQuant KV cache.
- **examples/README.md** — added `parity_check.py` documentation,
  `AEO_MOE_TRACE=1` nsys auto-wrap, pointed `.env` at the published
  HF checkpoint.
- **License** — switched from MIT to Apache 2.0 to align with the ML
  tooling ecosystem (transformers, accelerate, vLLM, turboquant).

### Documented

- Non-MoE FP8 quantization investigation results in
  `docs/gemma4-fp8-optimization.md`: 206 Linear modules converted,
  -840 MB VRAM, but 0% decode speedup and 46% parity divergence.
  Rejected — MoE-only FP8 remains the shipped configuration.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-15

Initial public release. Establishes the package structure, the bridge
pattern for wiring quantized weights into `transformers`, and a complete
FP8 path for Gemma 4 26B-A4B on NVIDIA Blackwell.

### Added

**Package foundation**
- Four-layer architecture: `core` (stdlib), `gpu` (torch + psutil),
  `bridges` (transformers), `plots` (matplotlib). Each layer only
  imports its own dependencies; `import aeo_quant` is always safe.
- `.env`-based configuration with `load_dotenv()` overriding shell env
  vars — single source of truth per checkout.

**Gemma 4 FP8 bridge** (`src/aeo_quant/bridges/gemma4/`)
- `Gemma4TextExpertsFP8` — drop-in subclass of the upstream
  `Gemma4TextExperts` that stores FP8 (`float8_e4m3fn`) expert weights
  with per-output-channel bf16 scales. Forward pass uses
  `torch._scaled_mm` with per-row dynamic input quantization.
- Class-swap loader (`load_gemma4_fp8`) — context manager that
  temporarily replaces the upstream expert class during
  `from_pretrained`, then restores it. No monkey-patching persists.
- Pre-converted fp32 scales at load time — eliminates per-call
  `squeeze/unsqueeze/float/contiguous` in the expert forward path.
  +30 MB memory, measurable prefill improvement.
- Opt-in NVTX trace markers (`AEO_MOE_TRACE=1`) for Nsight Systems
  profiling of the MoE expert path. `profile_generate.py` auto-wraps
  under `nsys` when the flag is set.

**Checkpoint builder** (`examples/build_checkpoint.py`)
- Shard-streaming FP8 quantization of fused 3D MoE experts from a
  bf16 safetensors source. Peaks ~18 GB RSS on a 26B model.
- Required because public Gemma 4 FP8 checkpoints ship with broken
  expert scales (see `docs/gemma4-fp8-results.md`).

**Benchmarking and diagnostics**
- `examples/profile_generate.py` — CUDA-event timing (prefill vs
  decode), optional `torch.profiler` kernel trace, stdout captured to
  timestamped `results/profiling/<ts>/stdout.log`.
- `examples/parity_check.py` — 50-token greedy regression canary
  against a pinned baseline (`tests/fixtures/parity_baseline.txt`).
- `examples/quality_check.py` — three-prompt smoke test for coherence.
- `CudaTimer` context manager and `mem_report()` for memory tracking.

**GPU utilities** (`src/aeo_quant/gpu/`)
- `quantize_3d_to_fp8` — per-expert per-output-channel FP8
  quantization for fused 3D weight tensors.
- Memory reporting with system, process, and torch allocator stats.

**Documentation**
- `docs/gemma4-fp8-results.md` — checkpoint build and validation.
- `docs/gemma4-fp8-optimization.md` — decode optimization log with
  active plan.
- `docs/gemma4-fp8-retrospective.md` — build effort retrospective.
- `docs/turboquant-gemma4-research.md` — TurboQuant KV cache notes.
